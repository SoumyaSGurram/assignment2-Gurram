###### The Metropolitan Museum of Art-New York
The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City, colloquially "the Met", **is the largest art museum in the Western Hemisphere**. Its permanent collection contains over two million works, divided among 17 curatorial departments. **The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue**, along the Museum Mile on the eastern edge of Central Park on Manhattan's Upper East Side, is by area one of the world's largest art museums. A much smaller second location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive collection of art, architecture, and artifacts from medieval Europe.
